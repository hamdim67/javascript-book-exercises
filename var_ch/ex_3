{
  let foo = 'bar';
}

console.log(foo);

(It outputs an error since foo is defined inside the block and we cannot access foo outside of the block because it is out of scope.
The 'let' statement creates variables with block scope, so we cannot access on the global object because, outside of the block, 'foo' does not exist)
