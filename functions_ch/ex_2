//  ////Exercise 2 (Function chapter) (make a function that
// that asks for user's first and last name in
//separate invocations, returning name as a string)



function greeter (fName, lName) {
    return `Hello, ${fName} ${lName}`
}


let fName = prompt('What is your first name?');
let lName = prompt('What is your first name?');


greeter(fName, lName);

//***Note: You CANNOT use 'prompt' in nodejs. It only works in the brower
//That's what 'rlSync' is for in nodejs */

//Here, I made 'fName' and 'lName' variables, which get user's 
//first and last name through a prompt. Then in the 'greeter' function
//I passed in those variables that I turned into prompts as parameters to the function. 
//And then I returned the 'fName' and 'lName' variables from that function
//as the statement 'Hello, fName lName'

//And then in the last part, I called the 'greeter' function 
//by passing in the 'fName' and 'lName' variables as parameters
