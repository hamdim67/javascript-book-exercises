//This doesn't log anything to the console
//b/c the function returns immediately
//after the return statement before we 
//console.log the result of 'words' variable

//**In non-strict mode, 'words' variable that
//isn't declared w/ 'let' or 'const' does NOT
//throw an error b/c we created an 'Implicit'
//global variabled on the global object. 
//We technically didn't create a variable;
//we actually created a property on the global window object
